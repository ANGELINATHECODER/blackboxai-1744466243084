# FitPals - Workout Tracker

## Project Overview

FitPals is a web-based application designed to help users track their fitness journeys by recording various workouts. The simple and intuitive interface allows users to log their exercise details, including exercise name, sets, reps, and weight, while keeping a history of their workouts for easy reference. This project leverages modern web technologies to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user experience.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. There is no need for additional setup since it is a static web application.

3. Ensure you have an internet connection to load external resources such as Tailwind CSS and Font Awesome.

- **Add New Workout**: Fill out the form by entering the exercise name, number of sets, reps, and weight. Click the "Add Workout" button to add the workout to your history.
- **View Workout History**: All entered workouts will be displayed below the form in the "Workout History" section.
- **Toast Notifications**: After successfully adding a workout, a notification will appear at the bottom of the screen.

## Features

- **Font Awesome**: A library for vector icons and social logos.

You can access these libraries via CDN links included in the `index.html`.

The project has the following structure:

```
